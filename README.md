# Card-Game-Launcher---JavaSwing

## Overview
This is a simple Blackjack game implemented using Java Swing. Players can place bets with "Peanuts," play the game by choosing to "Hit" or "Stand," and interact with a dealer. The game provides a fun user interface, displaying the player's hand, dealer's hand, and the current peanut balance.

The project also includes a basic game launcher that allows users to choose between Blackjack and other games (e.g., UNO).
